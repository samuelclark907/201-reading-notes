# Images

## Controlling the size of Images

- You can control the size of an image using the width and height properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

## Aligning Images

- Rather than using the `<img>` element's align attribute, web page authors are increasingly using the float property to align images.

## Aliging Images Center

- It should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block. 

1. On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.

2. On the image itself, you can use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.

## Background Images

- The `background-image` property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element.

## Repeating Images

- `repeat` - The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.

- `repeat-x` - The image is repeated horizontally only.

- `repeat-y` - The image is repeated vertically only.

- `no-repeat` - The image is only shown once.

- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.

- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.

## Practical Information

### SEO

- Search engine optimization is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

### On-page SEO

- In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords can appear in order to improve its findability.

- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it,
and what they do when they get there.

- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.

## Flash

- Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.

- Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
