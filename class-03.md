# Third Reading Assignment

## Lists

### Ordered List

- Is a list where each item in the list is numbered.
- The ordered list is created with the `<ol>` element.
- Each item within the list is placed between a `<li>` tag.

### Unordered List
- Is a list that begins with a bullet point.
- The unordered list is created using the `<ol>` element.
- Like the ordered list each item is placed between a `<li>` tag.
- Sometimes you may see a type attribute used with the `<ul>` element to specify the type of bullet point.

### Definition List
- Is made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.
- The definition list is created with the `<dl>` element.
- Inside the `<dl>` element you will usually see pairs of `<dt>` and `<dd>` elements.
- This `<dt>` is used to contain the term being defined.
- The `<dd>` element is used to contain the definition.

### Nested List
- You can put a second list inside an `<li>` element to create a sublist or nested list.

## Boxes

### Box Dimensions
- The three most common ways to specify the size of a box are using pixels, percentages, or ems.

- When you use percentages, the size of the box is relative to the size of the browser window.
- If the box is encased within another box, it is a percentage of the size of the containing box.
- When you use ems the size of the box is based on the size of text within it.

### Limiting height and width
- These are used to make sure the content doesnt appear too small or big on any screen.

### Overflowing Content.
- This property tell the browser what to do if the content of the box is to big or overflowing.
- There are two hidden and scroll.
- Hidden will hide the conent that doesn't fit in the box.
- Scroll will attach a scroll wheel to the box.

## Border, Margin, Padding

### Border
- Every box has a border. The border separates the edge of one box from another.

### Margin
- Margins sit outside the edge of the border. 

### Padding
- Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it. 

### Border Images
- `border-image:` property applies an image to the border of any box. It takes a background image and slices it into nine pieces.
- stretch stretches the image 
- repeat repeats the image
- round like repeat but if the tiles do not fit exactly, scales the tile image so they will

## Switch  Statements
- A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value. 

## Loops

### For Loops
- Used if you need to run code a specific number of times.

### While Loops
- Used if you dont know how many times you need ot urn your code.

### Do While Loops
- Like the While loop with a key difference it will run all the statements atleast one time.
