# CSS Transforms

- The `transform` property comes in two different settings, two-dimensional and three-dimensional. Each of these come with their own individual properties and values.

## Transform Syntax

- The transform property followed by the value. ex. `transform: scale(1.5);`

## 2D Transforms

- Elements may be distorted, or transformed, on both a two-dimensional plane or a three-dimensional plane.

- Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 

- Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.

- `Rotate` - The rotate function rotates the element clockwise by an angle defined with a single value.

- The `skew` function tilts the element by using one or two angle values.

- The `scale` function resizes the entire element when using one or two unitless numbers.

# Transitions and Animations

- You have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs.

- Allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes.

- The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

## Transitional Property 

- The `transition-property` determines exactly what properties will be altered in conjunction with the other transitional properties.

- Not all properties may be transitioned, only properties that have an identifiable halfway point.

## Transion Duration

- The duration in which a transition takes place is set using the `transition-duration` property.

- When transitioning multiple properties you can set multiple durations, one for each property.

- If multiple properties are being transitioned with only one duration value declared, that one value will be the duration of all the transitioned properties.

# Animations

- When more control is required, transitions need to have multiple states is where animations take over.

## Animation Keyframes

- To set multiple points at which an element should undergo a transition, use the `@keyframes` rule.

- The `@keyframes` rule includes the animation name, any animation breakpoints, and the properties intended to be animated.

## Animation Name

- Once the keyframes for an animation have been declared they need to be assigned to an element.  

- The `animation-name` property is used with the animation name, identified from the `@keyframes rule`, as the property value. The animation-name declaration is applied to the element in which the animation is to be applied to.

## Customizing Animations

- Animations also provide the ability to further customize an elementâ€™s behavior, including the ability to declare the number of times an animation runs, as well as the direction in which an animation completes.
