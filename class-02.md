 - HTML elements are used to describe the structure of
the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

# CSS

- The key to understanding CSS is to imagine there is an invisible box around eery element.
- CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
- A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
- The declaration also contain two parts: a property and a value.

## External CSS

The `<link>` element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page. 

## Internal CSS

- You can also include CSS rules within an HTML page by placing them inside a `<style>` element, which usually sits inside the `<head>` element of the page. 

# Basic JS Instructions

- A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.

- Some statements are surrounded by curly braces; these are known as code blocks.

- var is an example of a keyword the JS interpreter knows this is used to declare a variable.

- In order to use a varialbe you must give it a name or also called an identifier.

## Arrays

- An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values. 

- You create an array and give it a name just like you would any other variable.

- The values are assigned to the array inside a pair of square brackets, and each value is separated by a comma. 

- var colors;

  colors = ['white', 'black', ' custom']; 
  
  - JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
  
  - Expressions evaluate into a single value.
  
  - Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value. 
  
  ## Decisions and Loops
  
  ### Evaluations

- You can analyze values in your scripts to determine whether or note they match expected results.

 ### Decisions

- Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.

### Loops

- There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly.

### Other

- Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 

- if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false.
