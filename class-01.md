## Structure

<html>
<body>
 <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
 <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
 the page. And if the page is a long one it might
 be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
 <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
 you follow the structure of what is being written.
 There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level
 headings).</p>
 <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
 <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
</body>
</html>

`<html>`
  `<body>`
 `  <h1></h1>`
  `<p></p>`
 ` <h2></h2>`
  `<p></p>`
 ` <h2></h2>`
 ` <p></p>`
  `</body>`
`</html>`

- This is some basic html structure.
-HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
- Tags are often referred to as elements.
- Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

## Extra Markup

- `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
- The `<meta>` tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

## HTML5 Layout

-HTML5 offers a set of markup elements that allow you to create a structured layout for web pages.
- Lets you be more specific than just using a `<div>` tag all the time.
- Older browsers and OS have a little trouble reading the new html5 elements but can easily be remedied.

## Process and Design

### To understand the audience. 
- Every site has a specific target market. 
- Very important to understand who you audience is.

### To organize information.

- Your content and design should
be influenced by the goals of
your users. 
-
### Design theory for presenting information.
- Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
- Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

- Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

## JS Intro
- JS allows you to make web pages more interactive b y accessing and modifying content.

## The ABC of programming

1. Scripts - are made up of instructions that a computer can follow step by step.
2.Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically.

## How do computers fit in?
- Computers create models of the world using data.

- The models use objects to represent real things.
- Objects can have properties.
- Methods that perform tasks on the properties.

## Tips for writing script
- Keep JS in its own file and have the htmlpage link to that file.
- The `<script>` element is how you link your js file to your html file.
